# Quick Deploy

**Quick Deploy** is a streamlined platform for deploying web applications using a GitHub repository URL. Simply provide your repo link, and our system takes care of cloning, building, storing, and serving your application‚Äîall powered by Node.js backend services and a React frontend.

## üß† Architecture Overview

Quick Deploy consists of the following components:

### Backend Services (Node.js)

1. **Upload Service**

   * Accepts a GitHub repo URL from the frontend
   * Clones the repo
   * Uploads the source to S3/Cloudflare
   * Sends a message to SQS with an Upload ID

2. **Deploy Service**

   * Listens to SQS for new uploads
   * Builds the repo
   * Uploads build artifacts to S3/Cloudflare
   * Updates Redis DB with deployment status

3. **Request Handler Service**

   * Fetches the deployment status and files from S3
   * Responds to frontend/browser requests
   * Routes incoming traffic to the correct deployed application

### Frontend (React)

* A simple interface to input the GitHub repo URL
* Displays status updates and deployed app links

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **User submits a GitHub repo URL** via the frontend.
2. **Upload Service**:

   * Clones the repository.
   * Pushes source to S3.
   * Triggers **Deploy Service** via SQS.
3. **Deploy Service**:

   * Builds the application.
   * Uploads build files to S3.
   * Updates Redis with deployment status.
4. **Request Handler Service**:

   * Retrieves build files for the given ID.
   * Serves them to the browser.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Setup)

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18+)
* Docker (optional for Redis/SQS mock)
* Git

### Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/quick-deploy.git
cd quick-deploy
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd upload-service && npm install
cd ../deploy-service && npm install
cd ../request-handler-service && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### Run Redis and SQS (Locally)

Use Docker or AWS Localstack for local testing.

```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
# Use localstack or mock SQS for development
```

### Start All Services

```bash
# In separate terminals
cd upload-service && npm start
cd deploy-service && npm start
cd request-handler-service && npm start
cd frontend && npm start
```

## üåê Deployment

To deploy Quick Deploy to production:

* Set up hosted Redis, SQS, and S3/Cloudflare.
* Deploy services on serverless or container infrastructure (e.g., AWS Lambda, ECS, or Heroku).
* Configure environment variables for service integration.
